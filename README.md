<h1> Data Analyst and Cybersecurity Professional </h1>

# Hi, My name is Nohelis!
I am a 24-year-old girl who has liked technology and computing since I was little. I have learned all these years, but 6 months ago I began to deepen my knowledge and took a professional online course with Google which I enjoyed a lot and I gained a lot of experience and learning about programming, data security, software, how to detect threat actors or malware among others.
